This information was determined for the 03.02.06 firmware.
The firmware which shipped with my scope (03.01.18) had some GPIB command bugs.
The new firmware fixes many of those and seems to be faster, too.

--------

Commands marked "Secret" are those that aren't available from the front
panel, but should be.

General:

To set a parameter:
:PARAM value

To query a parameter:
:PARAM?

--------
Top-level commands:
WHO ARE YOU
        That's right, no colon prefix.
        Responds with "I'm RIGOL".

*IDN?
        Returns device information in a comma-delimited string:

        Manufacturer, model, serial number, firmware version

        The 03.01.18 firmware always reported its serial number as 0,
        so the serial number had to be retrieved with :SYS_INFO:ID:?.

*OPC?
        Returns 0 if there is an operation in progress or 1 if not.

*RST
        Loads the factory setup.  Probably the same as
                :SYS_PARAMETER:LOAD_FACTORY_SETUP

SYS RESET
        Don't use this.
        It's supposed to reset the scope, which it does, but then the scope
        crashes after initialization and has to be power cycled.

        The 03.01.18 firmware didn't display the logo correctly, but otherwise
        behaved in the same way.

--------
System information:
:SYS_INFO

Serial number:                  Queryable, not settable
        :ID?

        In firmware 03.01.18, this had to be issued as
                :SYS_INFO:ID:?
        instead of the current, correct
                :SYS_INFO:ID?

        Also this was the only way in 03.01.18 to get the serial number, since
        *IDN? didn't report it.

Module type:                    Queryable, not settable
        :MODULE?

        There are strings for EM5-PF, EM5-COM, and EM5-CM in the firmware.
        Perhaps only those three modules can possible be connected?

Ultrascope mode (?):            Queryable
        :ULTRASCOPE
        ON or OFF

        Ultrascope is the name of Rigol's scope software.
        This command does not appear to have any effect.

Language:                       Broken
        :LANGUAGE?

        This (kind of) queries and sets the language for the menus.

        The query causes the current language to be printed somewhere on the screen,
        in some color.
        It typically appears where the "AUTO" trigger text is or in the upper-left corner.
        It looks like the firmware has a current cursor position and color, and the
        current language is printed wherever that happens to be.

        To set the language:
        :LANGUAGE:x where x is:
                KOREAN
                JAPANESE
                ENGLISH
                FRENCH
                GERMAN
                ITALIAN
                SPANISH
        
        There are strings in the firmware for Portugese and simplified and traditional Chinese,
        but I haven't figured out how to make them work yet.

        Changing the language does not cause the screen to be refreshed.

        The language settings are broken.  Here is the mapping from language string to the
        language that is actually used:
                :KOREAN         Korean
                :JAPANESE       Japanese
                :ENGLISH        English
                :FRENCH         German
                :GERMAN         French
                :ITALIAN        Italian
                :SPANISH        Russian

        Interestingly, I have not found a string for Russian in the firmware.
        I also have not found a command that actually sets Spanish.

Frequency counter:              Queryable, settable
        :COUNTER

        The counter shows the frequency of triggers.

        To turn the counter on or off:
                :ENABLE (:ENAB) <0 or 1>
                :ENABLE? (:ENAB?)

        To read the counter's value:
                :VALUE? (:VAL?)

Beeper:                         Queryable
        :BEEP:ENABLED (:BEEP:ENAB) <0 or 1>
        :BEEP:ENABLED? (:BEEP:ENAB?)

        To cause a beep if the beep is enabled:
                :SYS_INFO:BEEP:ACTION (SYS_INFO:BEEP:ACT)

--------

Channel control:
:CHANNELn (:CHANn) where n=1 or 2

Bandwidth limit:                Queryable
        :BWLIMIT (:BWL) <0 or 1>
        :BWLIMIT? (:BWL?)

Invert:                         Queryable
        :INVERT (:INV) <0 or 1>
        :INVERT? (:INV?)

Scale:                          Queryable
        :SCALE (:SCAL) <V/div>
        :SCALE? (:SCAL?)

Input impedance:                Secret, Queryable
        :INPUT (:INP) <50O or 1MO>
        :INPUT? (:INP?)

        The query returns 50 (for 50 ohms) or 1e6 (for 1M ohms).

        According to the Rigol DS5000 docs, only certain models support this.
        At least the Agilent DSO3102A has the hardware, but doesn't provide
        front-panel access.

        When switching manually from GND to AC input, this is reset to 1MO.

Probe type:                     Queryable
        :PROBE (:PROB) <1, 10, 100, 1000>
        :PROBE? (:PROB?)

        No more than 4 characters of the value are parsed, and parsing stops at the first
        character that is not 1 or 0.  Thus, 12x == 1 and 10000 == 1000.

Offset:                         Queryable
        :OFFSET (:OFFS) <offset in volts>
        :OFFSET? (:OFFS?)

        :PULSE (:PULS)

        Commands under the each mode are available directly through :TRIG, e.g.:
                :TRIG:SLOPE POSITIVE
        instead of:
                :TRIG:EDGE:SLOPE POSITIVE)

        Some parameters are used by modes other than the ones where they are defined.
        For example, :TRIG:LEVEL is used by pulse, but it is canonically :TRIG:EDGE:LEVEL.
        Pulse does not have a seperate level.
:SAVERECALL (:SAV)
